# beat-the-bull
A silly BASIC game I wrote in 1986 for the BBC Micro

Inspired by a holiday in Herefordshire that same year with my family and friend Peter.

Guide your hiker across the field taking care not to be stampeded by the bull.

Controls:

* Z - Left
* X - Right
* \* - Up
* ? - Down

Under emulation you might need to use '@' instead of '*'
